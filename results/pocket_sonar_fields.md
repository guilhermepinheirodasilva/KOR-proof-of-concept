# Spatiotemporal Pocket Field Animations

This page presents the complete set of dynamic pocket field visualizations obtained from an exploratory molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the
KOR–SalA complex.

The animations are derived from a fixed spatial grid defined in Discovery Studio 2024, where different physicochemical properties are represented as scalar fields evolving over time.

All animations shown below are intended for qualitative inspection only.

## Notes

The preliminary molecular dynamics simulations are currently ongoing.  

The analyses and results presented correspond to partial trajectories (29 ns) obtained from a planned 200 ns production run.
