# Spatiotemporal Pocket Field Animations

This page presents the complete set of dynamic pocket field visualizations obtained from an exploratory molecular dynamics simulation of the
KOR–SalA complex.

The animations were generated from *.pdb* snapshots of the MD simulation using a fixed spatial grid defined in Discovery Studio 2024, with different physicochemical properties represented as time-evolving scalar fields. These visualizations are intended for qualitative assessment only.

As the number of mapped properties (channels) increases, manual frame-by-frame inspection becomes impractical, highlighting the need for an automated, data-driven analysis. Accordingly, the proposed PhD project aims to automate the extraction of grid-based descriptors for scalable computational workflows.
